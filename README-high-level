GTK FORTRAN -- High level interfaces
====================================

The high level interface for Gtk-Fotrtran is in the source file
gtk-hl.f90. This provides a number of higher level interfaces to the
GTK+ widget system, with the intent of making GUI construction more
accessible to scientific programmers (the feel should not be too alien
to anyone who has developed GUIs in IDL).

**WARNING** This module is still incomplete and is provided as a
  "taster".
