Building & Installing GtkFortran
================================

The build install system uses 'cmake'.

This is has been tested on Debian (Wheezy, Sid) and Pardus (2011)
Linux installations.

To do an "out of source" build from the top-level directory on a
Unix/Linux system: 
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    sudo make install

cmake variables are set by using -D<variable>=<value>
for example to change the default install directory from /usr/local to /usr:
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_DIR=/usr ..

To interactively control the build, use 'ccmake' in place of 'cmake'

Dependencies:
-------------

GtkFortran needs Gtk 2.24 or better (it will mostly work with 2.22) and
the associated libraries. For 2.xx use the "master" git tree, for 3.x
us "gtk3".

To build with gfortran, version 4.6 or better is needed (in 4.4 &
4.5 c_funloc doesn't work correctly, at least for Fortran routines with
the bind(c) attribute).

The build system needs cmake 2.6 or better and doxygen. 

GTK3:
-----

For the Gtk3 version, a FindGTK3.cmake module is included in the
distribution, it is placed in the cmake subdirectory which should be
added to the module search path by the top-level CMakeLists.txt rules.

N.B. FindGTK3.cmake has only been tested on Debian Sid, it is possible
that other systems may have different naming conventions (If you have
problems look for the lines with several asterisks in the comments, as
these are the places where I think there could be issues [i.e. I was
guessing until it worked]).
