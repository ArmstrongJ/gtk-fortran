Compile programs using as an example:

gfortran PATH_TO/gtk.f90 gtkhello2.f90 -o gtkhello2 `pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk+-2.0`

gtk.f90 and gtk-auto.f90 can be in the same directory as your main program. Regardless it has to be in the compile line to link. 

There are variations to this approach and I will add examples as I get time.

If using gfortran, requires version 4.6, a recent checkout from trunk.Also may require installing the related gtk+-2.0 devel packages from your distribution.

The gtk-auto.f90 file was generated with GTK+ 2.22. The cfwrapper.py script can be used to regenerate gtk-auto.f90, by typing python cfwrapper.py
